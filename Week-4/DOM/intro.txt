What would we cover in this week:
    -> Document Object Model(DOM)
    -> Connectin FE to BE 
    -> Chrome Developer tools
    -> Why Frontend frameworks

The Document Object Model API is a programming interface for web documents. It represents
the page so that program can change the document structure, style and content. The DOM represents the document as a tree of objects, each
object represents a part of the page

// What was Javascript
    -> It was an implementation of the ECMAScript spec
    -> But the JavaScript that runs in your browser has some extra functionality

-> Let's calculate a simple website to calculate the sum of two numbers
Making them dynamic is hard 
-> Changing the elements on the website omce the website is loaded
-> Actually calculating the sum based on the inputs and rendering it on the screen

// Back in the early 2000's we used classes and ID's in CSS to do frontend, later on they were replaced by React
DOM uses ID's
    -> refer to index.html
** Connecting Frontend to the backend **

// Let's say you dont have access to the calculation logic on the frontend.
Lets assume it's a hard problem that someone has exposed on a backend server, and you need to hit the backend server and get back the value
