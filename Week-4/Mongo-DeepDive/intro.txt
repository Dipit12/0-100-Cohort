// What is a database
    -> It's a place where data is stored persistently

Examples of data stored in database for linkedin:
    -> User data
    -> Users phone
    -> Users connection relationships
    -> Messages

Let's say you send a get request to see your feed, express servers do the auth check, and get the required data from the database
Why don't we let the user hit the database directly??
What extra does the http server provide exactly??
    -> Databased were created using protocols that browsers dont understand
    -> Databases dont have granual access as a first class citizen. Very hard to do user specific access in them
    -> There are some databases(firebase) that let you get rid of the http server and try their best to provide you the granola access

Database usually allows access to 4 primitives:
    -> Create Data
    -> Read Data
    -> Update Data
    -> Delete Data
    Popularly known as CRUD

Let's see the API for the mongoose library
Eventually we will be using Prisma(industry standard of doing this)
In mongoose first you have to define the schema
This sounds counter intutive since mongoDB is schemaless
This is true, but mongoose makes you define schema for things like autocompleteness/
Validating data before it goes in the DB, make sure you're doing things right
Schema DB's can be very dangerous, using schemas in mongo makes it slightly less dangerous

Defining Schema
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    email:String;
    password:String,
    purchasedCourses:[{
        type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObejctId,
        ref:"course"
    }]
})

const CourseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    title: String,
    price:5999,
});

const user = mongoose.model('User',UserSchema);
const Course = mongoose.model('Course',CourseSchema);

User.create({
    username: req.body.username;
    password: req.body.password
})
// Reading in a database
User.findByID("1");
User.findOne({
    username:"dipitmadan@gmail.com"
})
User.find({
    username:"dipitmadam@gmail.com"
})

// Updating in a database
User.updateOne({
    id:"1"
},{
    password:"newPassword"
})
User.update({},{
    premium:true
})

// Deleting in a database

User.deleteMany({}) // To delete everything in a database
User.deleteOne({
    username:"dipitmadan"
})

// 3 jargons to know in a database
    -> Cluster
        -> collection of databases
    -> Database
    -> Table
