// Authentication in real world
Lets say there is Mr.X who works in SBI bank
and there is Mr.Y who wants to open a bank account

// How does a bank function
    -> Mr.Y goes and opens a bank account
    -> Mr.Y deposits some money in the account
    -> Mr.Y gets back a cheque book from bank

    -> When i have to pay someone, i sign the cheque and everyone can see my sign
    -> People can try to do the same sign on their cheque book
    -> Bank won't accept their cheques but

    Your JSON web token is like your cheque book
    They are issued by the backend when you sign in
    Anyone can create something very similar, but the backend would reject it
    If you lose the original JWT, then it's a problem

    ChatGPT example
    -> Let's say you sign in into chatGPT with your username and password
    -> It's backend would return you with a JWT
    -> When you ask a question to it lets say: what is 2+2, you alos send the JWT token in the header for authorization, if its the same JWT issued by the backend of chatGPT, you would get your result

    3 things to do while creating a JWT:
        -> Generate 
        -> Decoding
        -> Verifying
