// Understanding Middlewares through examples

// When your chance comes and you dont have the ticket, the incharge there would kick you from there
// Middleware is this kind of a precheck.

Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of it's own.
An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls

Middleware functions do the following things:
    -> Execute any code
    -> Make changes to the request and the responsive objects
    -> End the request-response cycle
    -> Call the next middleware function in the stack;

-> Codifying this example - refer to index.js
