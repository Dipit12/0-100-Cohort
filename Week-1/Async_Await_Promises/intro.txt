Topics to cover in this class
-> Async Vs Sync Functions
-> Real use of callbacks
-> JS Browser Architecture
-> Promises
-> Async await

// What does Synchronous mean??
    -> Together, one after the other, sequential, only one thing is happening at a time

// What does asynchronous mean??
    -> Opposite of Synchronous
    -> Happens in parts 
    -> Multiple things are context switching with each other

Human brain and body is single threaded
    -> we can only do one thing at a time
    -> But we can context switch b/w tasks, or we can delegate tasks to other people

How does JS do the same? Can JS delegate?? Can JS context switch??
    -> Yess!!, Using asynchronous Functions

Until now we've only seen Synchronous Functions

Some common async Functions
    -> setTimeout
    -> fs.readfile - to read a file from your filesystem
    -> Fetch - to fetch some data from an API endpoint
