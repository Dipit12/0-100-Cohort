When a webpage is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model(DOM) of the page

DOM manipulation
    -> Selecting with id
        -> document.getElementById("myId")
    -> Selecting with class
        -> document.getElementsByClassName("myClass")
    -> Selecting with tag
        -> document.getElementsByTagName("p")    
    // better way
        -> document.querySelector(tags/id/class)
    // when we want all querySelectors
        -> document.querySelectorAll(tags/id/class);

Properties:
    -> tagName: returns tag for element nodes
    -> innerText: returns the text content of the element and all its children
    -> innerHTML: returns the plain text or HTML content in the element
    -> textContent: returns textual content even for hidden elements
