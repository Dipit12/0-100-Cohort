** Going to the doctor
    -> Doctors have a skill
    -> They have acquired that skill over years
    -> They provide service to other  people who want to use their skill\

    -> To expose this life skill, they open a clinic
    -> People who want to use their skill line up in a waiting room
    -> One by one, the doctor meets them
    -> The doctor is single threaded

Your logic is like a doctor
But what if you want to expose this logic to the world?
This is where HTTP comes into the picture
It lets you create a hospital where people can come and find you

How do i expose my doctor functionality to other ppl??
How can they find me? -> By creating an HTTP server
How do i create an HTTP server -> Express
