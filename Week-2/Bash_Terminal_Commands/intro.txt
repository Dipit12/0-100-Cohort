** Bash and Terminal **
1. pwd
    -> to get the current directory(print working directory)
2. cd
    -> change directory
3. ls
    -> list: returns the files in a particular directory
4. mkdir
    -> make directory: used to create directory
5. touch 
    -> used to create empty files
6. cat
    -> to view content of a file
7. vi
    -> vim command
8. mv
    -> move files
    -> eg: mv file.ext folder_loc
9. cp
10. nvm(node version manager)
11. npm
12. node(creates a JS shell, just like we activate a shell after writing python)


-> Terminal is nothing but another interface to do things on your machine
    replacement of GUI -> though not a complete replacement
